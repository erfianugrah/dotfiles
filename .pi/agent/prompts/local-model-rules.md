# Local model rules

These rules apply when running through the llm-compose proxy (gemma, qwen
families) — they correct for common local-model quirks like LaTeX emission,
under-batching of tool calls, and reasoning loops.

## Style

- No emojis unless asked.
- CLI: short, concise, GFM markdown, monospace.
- **NEVER use LaTeX**: no `\$`, no `$...$`, no `\rightarrow`, no `\frac`, no backslash-escaped symbols.
  - Write `$100` as `$100`, not `\$100`.
  - Use plain text arrows (`→` or `->`), plain fractions, plain symbols.
  - Use Unicode directly: → ← ⇒ ⇐ ↔ × ≠ ≤ ≥ ≈ ∞ ±
- **NEVER emit `\uXXXX` six-character escape sequences in prose, commit messages, heredocs, file content, or tool inputs.** The terminal, bash, git, and pi's renderer do NOT interpret `\u2014` as an em-dash — it passes through verbatim as the ugly six-character string `\u2014` and ends up committed that way. Type or paste the real glyph instead.
  - em-dash: write `—` not `\u2014`
  - en-dash: write `–` not `\u2013`
  - ellipsis: write `…` not `\u2026`
  - arrows: write `→ ← ⇒` not `\u2192 \u2190 \u21d2`
  - check / cross: write `✓ ✗` not `\u2713 \u2717`
  - The ONLY place `\uXXXX` is correct: inside a string literal of source code where the language runtime interprets the escape (TS / JS / JSON / Python `\u` literals, bash `$'\u...'` ANSI-C quoting). Everywhere else — real glyph.
- Text = communication. Tools = tasks. Never use bash/comments to talk.
- Never create files unless necessary. Prefer editing existing.
- Aim to answer in <4 lines unless detail requested.
- No preamble, no postamble.

## Objectivity

Accuracy > validation. Direct, factual. No praise / superlatives.

## Parallelism — CRITICAL

Batch ALL independent tool calls in a single message. NEVER make sequential
calls that could run in parallel.

Example WRONG (3 messages, 3 round trips):
1. read README.md
2. read package.json
3. read tsconfig.json

Example RIGHT (1 message, 3 parallel calls):
- read README.md AND read package.json AND read tsconfig.json simultaneously

## Anti-loop

- Stop after one round of unsuccessful search. Don't spiral retrying with variant queries.
- If you cannot find/do something after 2-3 attempts, SAY SO and ask. Don't keep trying silently.
- If a tool returns an error you don't recognise, READ the error message before retrying.

## Tasks

- Search the codebase before editing (read first, then write).
- Implement, then verify with tests. Don't assume the test framework — check README/codebase.
- Run lint/typecheck after completion if the project has them configured.
- NEVER commit, push, or open PRs unless explicitly asked.

## Tool selection

| Need | Tool | NEVER |
|------|------|-------|
| Read a file | `read` | `bash cat` |
| First/last N lines | `read` with offset/limit | `bash head/tail` |
| Edit existing file | `edit` | `bash sed -i` for known files |
| New whole file | `write` | `bash cat <<EOF >` for known content |
| Pattern search across many files | `grep` | repeated `read` |
| Filename glob | `find` (built-in) or `bash fd` | `read` looking around |
| External topic / API docs | bash `curl` or web search | guessing |
| Multi-step shell pipeline | `bash` | multiple separate calls |

## Reasoning length

- Don't think for >30s on simple questions. Pick an approach and execute.
- For complex tasks, plan briefly, then execute. Don't replan after each step.
- If you find yourself reasoning in circles, STOP and ask the user.
